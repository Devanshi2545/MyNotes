What is a programming language?

way to give instruction to computers. We give an instruction manual and the computer follows.
ex-moving mouse, playing games...
Without code, computer programs wouldn't do anything.
You wouldn't be able to move the mouse around on your screen.
You wouldn't be able to Google things.
You wouldn't be able to play Pokemon on your phone.

Computers don't understand English or any other language. It understands binary language(0,1).
It is hard for a human to communicate binary language so they developed a language in between human and machine language.
We take our source code to a translator that converts human code to binary language.
This translator is nothing but another code written by humans. Ex-interpreter(used by Python)-it goes line by line, and the compiler goes all one at a time.

Python-CPython  
Python interpreter will interpret CPython and create something called byte code...it gets rub on cpython virtual machine and converts to binary language(machine language)

PYTHON 2 VS PYTHON 3
At present we use python 3 (created in 2008)

Read this to see differences between python 2 and python3
-----------------------------------------------
Why there are so many languages?
The reason there are so many programming languages is that every programming language excels at some


things and well doesn't do so well at others.


It's all about trade off.

There is no ultimate language, and if a programmer tells you, Hey, my language is the best language.

They're probably junior developers that don't know what they're talking about.


Everything is a pro and con.
-----------------------------------------------
How python works?
Python gets written as source code.
We use this translation service called an interpreter to run this code, and then we'll spit out some instruction for our machines.
----------------------------------------------
Learning python
 you need 
 1. Terms-you're going to have to memorize things like statements, variables, instantiation.

 2. Data types-to store information
 
 3. Actions-All programming is is a way for us to tell our machines, Hey, store this data and then retrieve this data and perform some action on it.

 4. Best practices
 ------------------------------------------------
 WHY PYTHON?
 Designed for clear,logical code that is easy to read and learn.

 Lots of existing libraries and frameworks written in python allowing users to apply python to a wide variety of tasks.

 Focuses on optimizing developer time, rather than computer's processing time.

 python can be used for data science and machine learning
 for analysing large data files

 create visualizations
 
 perform machine learning tasks

 create and run predictive algorithms

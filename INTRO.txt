What is a programming language?

way to give instruction to computers. We give an instruction manual and the computer follows.
ex-moving mouse, playing games...
Without code, computer programs wouldn't do anything.
You wouldn't be able to move the mouse around on your screen.
You wouldn't be able to Google things.
You wouldn't be able to play Pokemon on your phone.

Computers don't understand English or any other language. It understands binary language(0,1).
It is hard for a human to communicate binary language so they developed a language in between human and machine language.
We take our source code to a translator that converts human code to binary language.
This translator is nothing but another code written by humans. Ex-interpreter(used by Python)-it goes line by line, and the compiler goes all one at a time.

Python-CPython  
Python interpreter will interpret CPython and create something called byte code...it gets rub on cpython virtual machine and converts to binary language(machine language)

#Fundamental Data type-values in python
int
float
bool
str
list
tuple
set
dict
#these work for storing and modifying information

#classes
#beyond these defined data types we can create custom types of our own called classes
#ex-supercars

#specialized datatypes
#They're not built into Python, but they're special packages and modules that we can use from libraries.

#Now, again, this is a topic that we'll cover later, but these are you can think of it as extra boosts

#whenever we don't have a data type that we want in the standard Python package.

#And maybe we don't want to create our own custom types.

#There are specialized data types that we can use from what we call modules.

#So you can think of it as extensions that we can add to the language.



None
#As the name suggests, means nothing.
#It's kind of like the idea of zero in math.
#It's the absence of value.
